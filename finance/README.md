# Finance libraries

This directory contains reusable Gleam libraries for finance plugins and other
applications. They do not import `pi_gleam`, export Pi extensions, or produce
artifacts under `dist/`.

The initial foundations, provider adapters, and early three-track domain
packages are **Experimental**. Their shared `0.1` layer is suitable for
developing plugins in this monorepo; public APIs and wire formats may still
change before stability.

The diagram shows dependency direction from foundation to consumer.
`finance_track` depends only on core and JSON; `finance_evidence` composes core,
track, and provenance; `finance_listing` owns only reusable effective-dated
identity primitives. `finance_series` depends on core and math; calendar depends
only on core, while the bounded market-calendar wrapper adds source, licence,
track, version, and coverage metadata. Shared market-rule, document, accounting,
and capability packages provide validation and selection laws; their CN/HK
consumers own market vocabulary and never import one another.
The authority contract validates track-scoped source ownership, official links,
operational access, redistribution, and limitations without embedding any
market's registry in the shared package.
`finance_testkit` depends on core and HTTP. `finance_openfigi`, `finance_sec`,
`finance_eastmoney`, and `finance_market_alpaca` remain reusable outside Pi and share the HTTP policies
rather than implementing plugin-local fetch stacks. Eastmoney's public-web
adapter is local-analysis-only with unknown latency, service level, and
redistribution; it preserves exact quote scaling and raw daily-bar lexemes
instead of presenting itself as an official or licensed feed. The SEC adapter
also owns lossless XBRL source-number
decoding and composes calendar arithmetic for explicit statement-period shapes,
so every consumer sees the same exact facts and period rules. No core package or core
test may depend on testkit or a provider adapter.

`finance_strategy` is an Experimental provider-neutral functional core for the
resolved completed-daily-bar `CG-SWING` workflow. It packages versioned
hypothesis data, projects per-input compatibility, round-trips exact evidence
receipts, validates LLM/user plan declarations, and folds
planned-versus-observed structural history. It deliberately emits no setup,
trade, recommendation, or plan-acceptance decision; the LLM owns those. It does
not own feature arithmetic, sizing, market rules, execution, providers, or Pi.

`finance_ohlcv` composes core, calendar arithmetic, exact series/math, and
canonical observations. Its `CG-MARKET-DATA` information contract preserves
known, unknown, not-obtained, conflicting, decode-failure, mechanical-check,
timing, quantity, rights, interrupted-acquisition, and available-operation
facts in a typed packet; none is an aggregate correctness or workflow verdict.
The stricter legacy `Bar`/`Batch` projection retains source lexemes beside
normalized decimals, validates geometry and ordering for requested
calculations, collapses only exact duplicates, and keeps provider pagination
completeness separate from evidence-backed calendar-gap classification. The
Alpaca adapter is its first US acquisition seam; IEX/SIP, credentials,
symbol-as-of identity, raw adjustment, and sourced rights remain explicit.

`finance_indicators` is the Experimental calculation-only core authorized by
the resolved `CG-TECH` contract. Its first slice implements exact SMA, Wilder
RSI, true range, and Wilder ATR with caller-selected input basis, window, gap,
parseable-value, seed/convention, and rounding policies. Canonical request and
semantic-result receipts bind ordered inputs, intermediate values, omissions,
unknowns, conflicts, evidence roots, and explicitly requested projections. It
emits no interpretation, readiness, signal, candidate, recommendation, or next
action; the LLM owns all of those decisions.

`finance_quote` is the smaller provider-neutral latest-quote contract. It
preserves exact price and size lexemes, market codes, source time, currency, and
canonical observation metadata, while refusing to infer consolidation,
freshness, session, or the provider's changing size semantics. The Alpaca
adapter supplies an explicitly selected IEX/SIP acquisition seam for it.

`finance_cn_testkit` and `finance_hk_testkit` are outward market-owned test
packages, not provider-neutral foundations. Each composes the base seeded
testkit and its own identity/calendar/rules/documents/accounting packages; an
architecture gate prevents either from importing the sibling market package.

## Functional architecture

All packages follow the repository's `FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md` standard. This is a
release gate, not a stylistic preference:

- domain values are immutable and created through validating constructors;
- parsing, normalization, finance rules, calculations, rendering, retry
  decisions, cache policy, and workflow transitions are pure functions;
- expected failure is an exhaustive `Result`, not a throw or sentinel value;
- clocks, randomness, HTTP, storage, hashing FFI, and file access are explicit
  capabilities interpreted at package boundaries;
- stateful policies expose pure reducers from previous state plus event to next
  state plus effects;
- deterministic production interpreters and scripted test interpreters obey the
  same contracts;
- tests cover laws, round trips, idempotence, invariants, and event sequences in
  addition to individual examples.

An effectful package such as `finance_http` is not exempt: network execution is
the shell, while request normalization, retry classification, delay choice,
rate-limit evolution, cache decisions, cassette matching, and error redaction
remain pure and independently testable.

The F0 Pi extensions and the
`sec_edgar`/`sec_xbrl`/`stock_fundamentals` F1 slices are now Experimental.
The isolated `us_quote`, `us_ohlcv`, `cn_ohlcv`, and `hk_ohlcv` slices are Experimental
over `finance_ohlcv`. US composes `finance_market_alpaca`; CN/HK independently
compose `finance_eastmoney`. Missing-session classification remains unavailable
until each shell composes its reviewed market calendar/status contract, and the
Eastmoney slices preserve date-only anchors and unknown provider volume units.
The US quote slice preserves bid/ask exchange, condition, tape, exact price and
size tokens, and unknown freshness/latency/size-unit semantics.
`stock_research_report` is a Pi plugin rather than a finance package. Its pure
domain module validates bounded copied Alpaca/SEC receipts and renders stable
source roots; its shell only registers the compositor and queues the explicit
agent workflow. It does not introduce another HTTP or provider dependency.
`watchlist` is likewise a Pi workflow plugin, not a provider or finance
foundation. It composes `finance_listing` keys and `finance_track`, keeps each
member's track explicit, and persists only bounded user-authored events in the
active Pi branch; it contributes no market-source coverage.
The SEC foundation also supplies pure exact-period filing resolution, strict
source-retaining Q4 subtraction, and comparable direct-fact trend validation;
provider I/O and Pi rendering remain outside those derivation laws.
`stock_fundamentals` composes those proven candidates with local `finance_math`
formula trees for free cash flow, net margin, and diluted EPS, retaining every
input instead of embedding arithmetic in its effect shell. Its growth and TTM
compositions additionally validate explicit calendar gaps, exact direct-quarter
continuity, and an annual-shaped complete TTM window. The complementary TTM
bridge retains and validates annual, current-YTD, and prior-YTD sources.
Mixed-quarter TTM uses an explicit direct/derived sum type and expands derived
Q4 observations into their direct annual and YTD formula leaves.
Named multi-input metrics may select each SEC accession independently, then
apply the pure same-period and same-filing proof before formula evaluation.
Later plugins should be selected
only after their provider adapters have endpoint, authentication, entitlement,
licence, pacing, pagination, and cache designs comparable to
`finance_openfigi` and `finance_sec`.

## Completed 0.1 foundation

The base supports provider-neutral exact values and observation envelopes;
closed `cn`/`hk`/`us` market-track identity and versioned result context;
typed evidence compatibility and explicit cross-track validation;
track/MIC-scoped listings with effective aliases and relationships;
source-labelled effective rules that fail on missing or conflicting regimes;
original-document/version/translation identity, strict versioned lossless wire
codecs, bounded attachment acceptance, and lossless accounting values with
executable ambiguity-preserving mappings;
safe cancellable HTTP with retry, rate, queue, cache, and cassette policies;
track-isolated provider priority with exact semantic fallback and per-family
85% union-coverage assessments that retain critical gaps and source groups;
separate equal-weight source-control credibility receipts whose percentage is
evidence maturity rather than truth probability;
arbitrary exact formula trees plus bounded approximate analytics; ordered,
missing-aware and as-of-aligned series with exact returns, OHLCV, paths, and
portfolio attribution; market sessions, business days, day counts, joint
calendars, and coupon schedules; canonical evidence manifests with bounded
verification; unit-aware bounded Markdown/CSV/JSON tables; and deterministic
synthetic/conformance test tools.

The first market-owned layers add separate CN and HK identity, calendar, rules,
document, accounting, and seeded scenario packages over those primitives.
CNINFO and HKEXnews now have bounded public local-analysis security/disclosure
discovery contracts and isolated Pi shells; they preserve candidate identity,
exact document paths, truncation, and rights limitations. Isolated calendar
shells compose source-reviewed, coverage-bounded 2026 SSE/SZSE/BSE and HKEX
schedules, including HK half-days. Authoritative venue security masters,
later-year/exceptional calendar refresh, broader rule regimes, production
market-data rights, PDF statement decoding, and accounting mappings remain open
source-evidence and rights work. Narrow official profiles cover established
normal mainland CNY equities from 2026-07-06 and applicable HKD equity spread
bands from 2026-08-03; HK board lots remain issuer-specific caller evidence.
Shared Eastmoney quote/history and exact vendor income-statement decoding backs
isolated CN/HK shells with bounded mocked contracts. The statement slice keeps
raw tokens and labels, visible track-owned mappings, and exact net-margin source
leaves; it remains distinct from official filing/document semantics.
The shared capability policy powers isolated `cn_setup`/`hk_setup` Pi shells
and prevents sibling or SEC tools from satisfying a track requirement.

“Foundation complete” does not mean “every named financial model is built in.”
Provider adapters, accounting taxonomy mappings, maintained calendar data,
curve construction, optimizers, option models, order execution, and live data
entitlements remain separate packages or plugin work. The generic primitives
are deliberately sufficient for those layers without putting provider or
business policy into the foundations.
